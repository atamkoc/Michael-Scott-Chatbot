# Michael Scott Chatbot

For this project, I used the 9 Season script of the show "The Office" and coded a Michael Scott chatbot with DialoGPT.

This folder contains a .csv file with show script and a report where I analyzed my trained chatbot.

Special thanks Fabrizio Cominetti for creating such a dataset and sharing on kaggle.com
